# Use Cases
Please Note that you shouldn't depend on this Protector Protection, it's are mainly for testing and exploring how obfuscation and packing/licensing may work.

Some use cases are:

* Packing your program with a specific HWID so that it runs on your pc only and people with physical access can't steal it easily.

* Packing your program with a specific USB HWID so that it runs on different PCs with a trusted USB without easily tampering your program code.
